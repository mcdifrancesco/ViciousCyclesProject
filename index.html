      <p>My name is Matthew DiFrancesco, I'm a 19 year old college student currently studying web development at wake tech. Previously in high school I mainly focused on graphic design throughout my 
        high school experience. I started teaching myself web development in the summer of 2021 and fell in love with it, prompting me to study it further in college.</p>
