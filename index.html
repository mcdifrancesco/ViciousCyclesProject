      <h1 id="who">Who are We?</h1>
      <p id="whomain">Vicious Cycles is your locally owned and family run bike store. We have all the bikes you can want, from mountain bikes, to BMX bikes, casual bikes, and now featuring our own electric bikes!
          We sell both new and used bikes, so we have bikes to fit every price range and need and even have our own in-house bike repair facility. 
      </p><br>

      <h2 id="philo">Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p id="philomain">Our philosophy is that when you choose your bike, you should choose it based on the folks who will not only build your bicycle, but also those who will help you get comfortable on the bike,
        as well as provide service down the road as you need it. The best things in life are pretty simple. Riding bikes with friends, discovering new places and finding new trails are definitely included.
         Riding bikes helps us to disconnect from the hectic and noisy world and connect with friends, nature and ourselves. It might just be the best thing ever.
        <br><br>
        We, just like everyone, are starting to move and push towards helping everyone use all the technological advancements they can with as much ease as possible. We are on the front lines of making the most 
        ergonomical and cost effecient electric bikes. We strive to be the best we can and serve the community as much as we can.
